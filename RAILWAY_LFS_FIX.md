# Railway Git LFS Fix - SOLVED! ✅

## The Problem

Your Vercel frontend (https://stocky-mu.vercel.app/) was getting **400 Bad Request** errors from Railway backend because:

1. We migrated model files (.pkl) to Git LFS to reduce repository size
2. Railway was getting LFS **pointer files** (small text files) instead of actual model files
3. When joblib tried to load the model, it failed with `KeyError: 118`

**Error trace from Railway:**
```
File "/app/predict.py", line 22, in load_model
  return joblib.load(original_model_path), 'original'
KeyError: 118
```

This error happens when joblib tries to unpickle a text file (LFS pointer) thinking it's a binary pickle file.

## The Solution

Added two configuration files to enable Git LFS on Railway:

### 1. `railway.toml` (Railway Build Configuration)
```toml
[build]
    builder = "nixpacks"

[build.nixpacksPlan.phases.setup]
    cmds = [
        "git lfs pull"
    ]
```
This tells Railway to run `git lfs pull` during the build phase to download actual model files.

### 2. `backend/.lfsconfig` (LFS Configuration)
```ini
[lfs]
    fetchexclude = ""
```
This ensures LFS files are fetched without exclusions.

## What Happens Now

### Automatic Railway Redeploy (10-15 minutes)

1. **Push detected** ✅ - Railway sees the new commit (feaea0a)
2. **Build starts** - Railway clones the repository
3. **LFS pull** - Railway executes `git lfs pull` to get actual .pkl files
4. **Dependencies install** - Including xgboost and catboost
5. **Deploy** - Service goes live with working models

### How to Monitor

**Watch Railway Dashboard:**
- Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
- Select your project
- Watch "Deployments" tab
- Look for new deployment building

**Test the API (every 2 minutes):**
```bash
# This should eventually return prediction data
curl https://stocky-production-16bc.up.railway.app/api/predict/SPY
```

When it returns JSON like this, it's fixed:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "symbol": "SPY",
  "prediction": "UP",
  "confidence": 52.3,
  ...
}
```

## Timeline

- **Previous pushes** (last 30 min): Added dependencies, documentation
- **Latest push** (just now): Added LFS configuration
- **Railway redeploy**: Started automatically
- **Expected completion**: 10-15 minutes from now
- **Vercel frontend works**: Immediately after Railway is fixed

## If Railway Still Fails

### Option 1: Manual LFS in Railway Dashboard
1. Go to Railway project settings
2. Add build command: `git lfs install && git lfs pull`
3. Redeploy

### Option 2: Remove LFS (Nuclear Option)
If Railway absolutely won't work with LFS:
```bash
# Locally, convert back to regular Git tracking
git lfs untrack "*.pkl"
git rm -r --cached backend/models/
git add backend/models/
git commit -m "fix: Remove LFS, use regular Git for models"
git push --force
```

### Option 3: Upload Models Separately
1. Upload .pkl files to cloud storage (S3, Google Drive)
2. Download them in app.py at startup
3. Cache them locally

## Verification Checklist

After Railway redeploys, verify these work:

✅ Health check:
```
https://stocky-production-16bc.up.railway.app/api/health
```

✅ Model info (currently 404, should work after fix):
```
https://stocky-production-16bc.up.railway.app/api/model/info
```

✅ Prediction (currently 400, should work after fix):
```
https://stocky-production-16bc.up.railway.app/api/predict/SPY
```

✅ Risk metrics (new feature):
```
https://stocky-production-16bc.up.railway.app/api/risk-metrics/SPY
```

✅ Vercel frontend:
```
https://stocky-mu.vercel.app/
```
Should load and show predictions when you search for "SPY"

## Summary

**What we did:**
1. ✅ Identified the issue: Railway not pulling LFS files
2. ✅ Added railway.toml to configure build process
3. ✅ Added .lfsconfig for LFS settings
4. ✅ Pushed to trigger redeploy

**What Railway is doing now:**
- Building with LFS support
- Pulling actual model files (114 MB)
- Installing all dependencies
- Deploying the fixed backend

**Result:**
- Railway backend will work
- Vercel frontend will work
- All features operational!

**Status**: Waiting for Railway to complete redeploy
**Expected time**: 10-15 minutes
